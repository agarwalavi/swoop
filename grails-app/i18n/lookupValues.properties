# Put your lookup realm codes and their translated values here. Entries in this
# file should be in the format lookups.realm.code=Translation text. For example:
#
# lookups.order.status.R=Received
# lookups.order.status.D=Despatched
#
# In the above examples, 'order.status' is the lookup realm and R and D are two
# codes you have created in that realm.
