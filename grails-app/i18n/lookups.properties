lookup.realm.help=Enter the name for this set of code/value pairs (e.g. countries \
  or order.status etc.)
lookup.codeType.help=Select the data type of the codes that this realm will use.
lookup.codeMinimum.help=For string code types, enter the minimum length of the code. \
  For integer, decimal and date codes, enter the minimum value permitted as a code. \
  Integer and decimal minima may have a leading minus sign. Decimal minima must use \
  a dot (.) as the decimal separator. Date minima must be entered strictly in the \
  format yyyy-MM-dd, or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm if a time is to be included. Leaving \
  this field blank will be taken to mean that there is no minimum.
lookup.codeMaximum.help=For string code types, enter the maximum length of the code. \
  For integer, decimal and date codes, enter the maximum value permitted as a code. \
  Integer and decimal maxima may have a leading minus sign. Decimal maxima must use \
  a dot (.) as the decimal separator. Date maxima must be entered strictly in the \
  format yyyy-MM-dd, or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm if a time is to be included. Leaving \
  this field blank will be taken to mean that there is no maximum. Any maximum \
  entered must be greater or equal to any minimum that has been entered.
lookup.codeScale.help=For decimal code types, enter the number of digits that a \
  code should have AFTER the decimal point (1..10). For date codes, enter a 1 if \
  a code is to consist of just a date, or 2 if it is to have both a date and a \
  time. For all other code types, leave this field blank.
lookup.valueType.help=Select the data type of the values that this realm will hold.
lookup.valueMinimum.help=For string value types, enter the minimum length of the value. \
  For integer, decimal and date values, enter the minimum value permitted as a value. \
  Integer and decimal minima may have a leading minus sign. Decimal minima must use \
  a dot (.) as the decimal separator. Date minima must be entered strictly in the \
  format yyyy-MM-dd, or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm if a time is to be included. Leaving \
  this field blank will be taken to mean that there is no minimum.
lookup.valueMaximum.help=For string value types, enter the maximum length of the value. \
  For integer, decimal and date values, enter the maximum value permitted as a value. \
  Integer and decimal maxima may have a leading minus sign. Decimal maxima must use \
  a dot (.) as the decimal separator. Date maxima must be entered strictly in the \
  format yyyy-MM-dd, or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm if a time is to be included. Leaving \
  this field blank will be taken to mean that there is no maximum. Any maximum \
  entered must be greater or equal to any minimum that has been entered.
lookup.valueScale.help=For decimal value types, enter the number of digits that a \
  value should have AFTER the decimal point (1..10). For date values, enter a 1 if \
  a value is to consist of just a date, or 2 if it is to have both a date and a \
  time. For all other value types, leave this field blank.
lookup.ordering.help=When displaying a list to the end user of values to select \
  from for this realm, the select list can be displayed in code order, value \
  order or by specific sequence number entered in the code/value record. Select \
  how you would like the list of values displayed to the end user.
lookup.internationalize.help=This field only applies when the values in this \
  realm are of type 'String'. If you check this field then, when displaying a \
  list of values to the end user, the lookup system will create a key in the \
  format lookups.realm.code, where 'realm' is the name of this realm and 'code' \
  is one of the codes within the realm. It will then attempt to find that key \
  in the internationalization texts of your system. If no message with the \
  requisite key is found, the raw value will be used as a default.
lookup.cache=Lookup Cache
lookup.cache.max=Maximum cache size
lookup.cache.size=Current cache size
lookup.cache.count=Current number of entries
lookup.cache.hits=Number of hits
lookup.cache.misses=Number of misses
lookup.cache.disabled=Caching has been disabled. Alter the lookups.cache.size.kb \
  setting in Config.groovy to enable caching.
lookup.cache.reset=Reset

lookupValue.lookup.help=Select the lookup realm to which this value belongs.
lookupValue.code.help=Enter the particular code within the lookup realm that \
  this entry represents. For example, if the lookup realm was 'countries', then \
  this code might be 'US'.
lookupValue.value.help=Enter the value to be returned for this code within the \
  lookup realm. For example, if the lookup realm was 'countries' and the code \
  was 'US' then the value might be 'United States of America'. String values \
  can be from 1 to 100 characters long. Integer and decimal values may have a \
  leading minus sign, if required. Decimal values must use a dot (.) as the \
  decimal separator. Date values must be entered strictly in the format of \
  yyyy-MM-dd, or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm if a time is to be included.
lookupValue.sequencer.help=If lists of values shown to an end-user for this realm \
  have been specified (in the realm definition record) to be ordered by sequencer, \
  then enter the sequence number here for this code/value pair. It is good practice \
  to leave gaps between sequence numbers (e.g. 10, 20, 30 etc rather than 1, 2, 3 \
  etc) but this is not mandatory. There may even be duplicate sequence numbers, \
  though this rather defeats the object. If end-user selection lists are not to be \
  displayed in sequencer order, this field should be set to zero.
